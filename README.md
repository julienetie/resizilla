#resizilla v0.3
--- 
Window resize with debounce & requestAnimationFrame.  
 
    resizilla(handler, delay, inception).call(window); 
 
- handler: Function to execute on resize, 
- delay: Delay of the function call in ms on resize, 
- inception: If true the function call at the beginning of the detection period, if false the call will be at the end of the detection period (false by default), 

Recommendation: Use a moderate delay for consistency with legacy browsers.

    resizilla.enableMobileResize();
 
The behavior of mobile orientation & resizing varies amongst devices.
